## Rearranging Fields
To customize your Pivot Table, you can rearrange the fields in the Pivot Table Fields pane. You can simply drag and drop fields to different areas to change the way data is organized and displayed.

1. Drag and drop a field from the "Rows" area to the "Columns" area, or vice versa, to change the orientation of the data.
2. Move a field from the "Rows" or "Columns" area to the "Values" area to aggregate the data by that field.
3. Remove a field from the Pivot Table by dragging it out of its current area.

## Applying Filters
Filters help you focus on specific data by displaying only the data that meets certain criteria. To apply filters to your Pivot Table:

1. Drag a field to the "Filters" area in the Pivot Table Fields pane.
2. In the Pivot Table, click on the drop-down arrow next to the field in the Filters area.
3. Choose the values you want to display in the Pivot Table and click "OK."

## Sorting Data
You can sort the data in your Pivot Table to better analyze and compare the information. To sort data in your Pivot Table:

1. Click on the drop-down arrow next to the row or column header you want to sort.
2. Choose "Sort A to Z" or "Sort Z to A" to sort the data in ascending or descending order, respectively.

## Grouping Data
Grouping data in a Pivot Table can help you summarize and analyze data at different levels. To group data in your Pivot Table:

1. Right-click on a cell in the row or column that you want to group.
2. Select "Group" from the context menu.
3. In the "Grouping" dialog box, choose the options that best suit your needs, such as grouping by dates or numeric ranges.
Click "OK" to apply the grouping.


## Changing Summary Functions
By default, Excel summarizes numerical data using the SUM function. However, you can change the summary function to better suit your analysis. To change the summary function:

1. Right-click on a cell in the "Values" area of your Pivot Table.
2. Select "Summarize Values By" from the context menu.
3. Choose the summary function you want to use, such as COUNT, AVERAGE, or MAX.
